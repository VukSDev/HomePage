### About

This is a simple home page with a few functionalities that might be useful to the user.

It will have a todo list embeded in the sidebar, a search bar that changes it's search engine depending on the command the user gives it, for example:
-ddg converts the search engine to duck duck go, -g to google, -w to wikipedia etc

There will also be an input field that takes a link of a 1920x1080 image to change the wallpaper.
